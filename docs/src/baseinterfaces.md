# BaseInterfaces reference

BaseInterfaces.jl is a work-in-progress package to define
the major base julia interfaces in Interfaces.jl syntax.

As many of these are not actually clarified yet, even in docstrings,
this is a difficult task and can't be 100% reliable.

But at least trying is worthwhile to get the ball rolling.

If you would like this interface to be more useful, and actually 
registered, please contribute tests to the interface specs and new 
interface we have not yet defined.
